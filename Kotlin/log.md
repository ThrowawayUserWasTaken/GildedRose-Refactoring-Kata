# Log to keep some notes.

- Just noticed the "./gradlew -q text" command in the README does not work. Won't fix that. Will write my own tests to fix that.

## Approach
Every task defined in the [requirements](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.md)
should be a separate branch, so every PR could run the pipelines to assume quality. For now, that's 
totally overkill.
